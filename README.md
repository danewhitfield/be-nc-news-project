+ if green - you're good to go!
- if red - you need to troubleshoot :(
! if yellow - ignore it ever happened and move on...
# disclaimer - I refuse liability for you ignoring the yellow.
```

## **.ENV**

To setup your environments you need to create 2 files:

```
.env.test
```

```
.env.development
```

These need to be added to your **_.gitignore_** if not already.
